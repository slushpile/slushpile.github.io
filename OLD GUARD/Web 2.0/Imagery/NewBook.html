Excuse me, but  hold my beer. I have something I need to write. I
need to explore the invisible and the unknown. I need to explore
something that makes me feel alive. I need to write. Hold my beer.
Let me get to this. Let me get to this writing that I need to do. I’m
turned on by rhetoric. I’ll write some rhetoric. What is this
about? This is about writing.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">My internet has been
acting funny lately so the last thing I did with it was download a
word processor. I used to do this. I used to write prolifically in
the word processor and then I found my way to social media and now
I’m sort of looking forward to this logical conclusion that it is
not hard to deal with cerebrally and I can write off line. I don’t
think I need the computer to publish. I need a local drive word
processor and a thumb drive to mail my files in. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Men that get in
trouble are taken with beauty. Its a dance done by savants and
elitists alike. There is so much more to this. I could be in trouble
one day. Because the world was spinning and I wasn’t getting dizzy
I was confused.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>
My internet
just died again. For like the 10<sup>th</sup> time in 2 days too. My
computer is getting old. I have an old computer. I think it’s
computing. I think my computer is computing. There is more to this
than there seems. I have sensitive hands. Sometimes I think to myself
why should I be this way. It’s hard to notice but you can take the
time it takes to be a certain way. What if you had the time to 
yourself to notice that you were something delicate in a hands are
missing there is a whithering of whisperness that happened to us
yesterday. It’s mine. It used to be yours but now it’s mine. I’m
a little bit of a encumberance that needed fleshed out and developed
into a form that is more pleasing than you could know if you knew if
you really knew and took on a role of abstinence in the forgotten
worlds we work with.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Just the local
drive. I am on my local drive again. It’s pretty serious losing the
internet I just went cold turkey. I’m pretty dedicated to using
this offline word processor and getting to the work of doing
somtehing like looking at this like it’s an opportunity. I have the
opportunity to have my internet offline. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>
The previous
four pagraphs used periods at length. I was bringing back the period.
All, hail punctuation. We ( desperately ) have an obligation to
ourselves to explore every nuance of writing. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I just I don’t
know. I’m different now. I take medication. I wanted to share this
piece of prose to give you insight into my intelligence. I’m on
lithium and benzotropine and flufenazine and I’m really well
behaved but I think like this. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">This is for the
mentally ill. No. This is the the mentally healthy on permanent
disability for mental illness. For the people with university degrees
and live on disability for them. For the people that diagnosedm
mental illness at school. For the people that  graduated from high
school and went to university pretty certain they just made a good
decision.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">You can tell that
I’m normal. I’m normal and a product of my enviornment. Just like
the rest of us. We’re all babies just like all the other babies but
we grew in time and experienced life and now we’re what went into
us manifested.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I just sat down
again to use my computer without the internet immediately I thought
to myself prepare to use twitter but there was no twitter it’s
online and I’m not bout not being online 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">These are called
tweets. I have had my attention span eroded by reading in social
media. I can do this now. At <a href="https://slushpile.github.io/">https://slushpile.github.io</a>
you’ll see an example of my writing right out of college and this
is me 10 years later. I smoked weed and am currently on
pharmaceuticals that keep my behavior in line. You can find me rollin
on dubs smoking the co co puffs you can find me laced with cash
undred bills under the dash waiting on more cash. Or something
nothing I just wonder what you are interested in.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It’s a tweet it’s
definitely a tweet. We’re talking tweets here. 280 Character tweets
or something like that this is the word processor we can round and
round up and round down and be fine with it just making it work. I
definitely tweeted you.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">I think I just want
to do this. I think I do. I think this is what I want to do. I just
want to be typing in a word processor. It suits me.
