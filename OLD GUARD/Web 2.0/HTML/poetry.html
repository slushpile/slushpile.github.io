	as i understand poetry there is eleborate writing but poetry REAL POETRY is taking something HUGE like show business and breaking it down to just blink your eyes kid like POETRY is when you take capitalism and just explain it like that's spending money like poetry is when you explain government as that type of people like poetry is when you take a huge idea a major concept like string theory and point out gravity is probably a fluid that is washing over atoms like when gravity and the atom got to together there was nothing left to do but build a universe

								I wrote out a perfect plan that was too perfect
							Ther was a moment I was thinking about my hardship
									This shit was not easy believe me
						
						Please believe me
						              
									  I was coated in existence and had broken thin
							With dreams more real than reality
							                                          I had time to write poetry
