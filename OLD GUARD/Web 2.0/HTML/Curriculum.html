this is a website dedicated to ideally setting me up with a work place on a limited budget 

i write on a regular routine and i need a place to store snippets of writing

ideally you can fork this project and add comments and participate in an expert discussion forum

there is a need for me to express myself and i can only do it with a desktop computer

i appreciate the web hosting and i can put a portfolio together here and find work

my ideal website is a website that is just a content directory with no index file but i don't want to set that trend

so i'll work on some css zen garden type work 

i have to develop the content first so it's just going to be bare bones for awhile 


5/2/2022

now it's done. you can access the book on this website now and you can make edits for yourself
and print your own version of the book you can take my book make a 15% change to the book add a character
change a setting rewrite a monologue you can do something like that and then you can sell your own copy of 
the book as your own version i did some community work on the internet 

it's pretty straight right now

i was going to back up these files

caveat you do not get the disqus comments if you work with your own fork it will disappear because the URL is different
i can probably send you a file if you want to upload it to your own but i don't know if this would work i want that hot website 
idea on more than my own website but just copy and paste it the rest is garbage

2/11/2023

i successfully downloaded the .xml file that is my disqus archiving file format and now i have the entire 
download on my download drive and i can now completely copy my website WHAT I AM SAYING! is that if you want to
buy my main website as a starting kit like if you want to have a design fleshed out so you can immediately
begin collecting traffic like you can copy my website flawlessly and we can work something out if you want to
try out a new hobby i would not recommend this unless you have pretty decent typing skills and know your way around
a computer like if you work in an office and do office work professionally like this is a career option
for a consummate professional if you accidentally saw this it might look good but move along

2/12/2023

I had a perfect design when i auto linked to to a google document that is the perfect design
but it's not as good for github as i would like it to be so consider auto linking to a google document
with comments on per the link or something i don't know it's really mushy in terms of logic this
but i have github i don't know i'm confused so i'm just doing some A B testing to see which works the 
best

i'm done basically with content production i just have to figure out how to produce a relationship
with someone that would advertise at the top of my site so that advertisers are involved
in my magazine like i have a magazine i need like 400 people to advertise on my website at the top
every month for $300 each and that's my dream that's my reason for doing all this is to get that
advertising dollar with like six yards of space dedicated to advertising 

http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/

i'm doing that basically but not like an evil sadistic cud fuck like i want valuable advertising
like i want to take the super bowl ads and incorporate them into my website with 200 more and then by the time you
stop scrolling through ads you feel like it was worth it
