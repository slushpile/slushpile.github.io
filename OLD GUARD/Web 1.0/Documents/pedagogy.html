	There are students that might want a more athletic curriculum we have a school for the creative and performing arts but there should be a school for the athletic arts and we have a ballet that is a controlled gymnasium that lets loose with fury but a gym a weight room like what if high school was laid out like a college campus what if that college lifestyle was taught from kindergarten what if it wasn't school from 9 to 5 5 days a week what if it was more casual what if we weren't sprinting knowledge into these kids what if we educated just saying we could identify a kid a there are kids that like to read so let them read there are kids that love to run let them run there are kids that love to play let them play like the gospel of academia like what school does a kid go to? the one within walking distance

	yeah if you want a weird life go to university really only go to university if you want a weird life if you want a mild mannered breezy all you need to do is write a song life avoid university and definitely don't go for 10 years but if you want a weird life where you might become telepathic if you're chosen for the study go ahead and join university and keep an open mind because at 18 coming out of high school you're meat but like university is what expertly seasons the meat and produces unique people to the extent you spend time in university is to the extent you will be unique up and including post doctoral work where you are guaranteed to be unique but not going to university leads to filling a stadium with people if you go a certain route and that shit happens everyday every day like 1200 venues across the usa are filled but it's only 1200 so you're in an elite class of didn't go to univeristy if you're on stage but there is corporate and there is university and there's a blend i'm just saying guaranteed the university is going to lead you to a unique life if you go but if you don't go to university you have the corporate desk the retail clerk the factory worker the delivery person or the stage and that's most of it right there not going to university i went to university for 10 years an even though i can't explain it i have had an apartment for 10 years and my student debt is paid and i have internet access so from my perspective i can state university is the way to go and that's not just because i did it it's because i notice so many people want what i have and it's an education so get one
