this is a website dedicated to ideally setting me up with a work place on a limited budget 

i write on a regular routine and i need a place to store snippets of writing

ideally you can fork this project and add comments and participate in an expert discussion forum

there is a need for me to express myself and i can only do it with a desktop computer

i appreciate the web hosting and i can put a portfolio together here and find work

my ideal website is a website that is just a content directory with no index file but i don't want to set that trend

so i'll work on some css zen garden type work 

i have to develop the content first so it's just going to be bare bones for awhile
