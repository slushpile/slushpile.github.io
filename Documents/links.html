		Student Achievement Increasing Programs
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		I was told only well behaved students could participate in this but if you think you were judged poorly in school consider enrolling your child or daughter in some of these programs and participating yourself. I am a healthy university graduate with a spectacular achievement record and I am presenting these influences as evidence that there would be atypical results coming from me.
