	Code

	<p>
	
	I was going to explain in detail what this code does and send it off to an agent ... the same agent i am going to sell all my shit to ... she doesn't have a choice in the matter she's my agent
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	this code is written in processing ... it's called processing code ... it's standard java formatting ... it's quite easy to do one of the things that's so frustrating about processing is that you can do hot little shits without much coding knowledge ... like if you know the basics of programming you can do a nice little mouse cursor disappear thing or if you're clever you can put a little graphic together ... like processing the kind of language where naw you ain coding grand theft auto and some other astonishing impossibility without 300 worth of coding going into the software ... like processing about lines moving in conjuction with your mouse or processing about like drawing grids and shit like the higher echleons of processing are well fleshed out but the inspirational material is weak for a lot of the functions of processing ... like processing in book form ... well no they do they do provide you with a code example and a graphic depicting the code no they do have a book with every function in it ... illustrated i was going to say they didn't but then i thought about it like i haven't done actual writing in so long like i can write about code and tell you my problems i could write drama but i'd rather write code the majority of my reading work load was computer reference materials and i got to the point i was going to take it up with the board of education that if they want drama free schools they would want drama free reading materials which would be computer reference manuals and i know you're like english and history and chemistry but if all that came in at university and in high school it was just coding materials like if every student learned to code  code.org dreams coming true if it needed A REASON to be that way let it be drama free schools and i swear to god i haven't written like ever before this my first real writing this the best feeling i could possibly hope to imagine to be assigned writing about code i'm smitten write now going to go have a smoke bye ...
