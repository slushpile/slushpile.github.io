	<strong>
	Politics
	</strong>
	
	<p>
	Politics is the discussion of who gets what. You have the supply chain and thats what they do and then you have the people dependent on the supply chain and that's what they do and you have the people set aside from society and that's what they do and it's the conversaiton we have collectively over who gets what. Like in it's purest form politics is the discusson of which of us is going to work what do they get and which of are not going to work and what do they get and all of that it's a federal conversation involving 400,000,000 people and all walks of life need something and the government discusses at a high level with plans and strategies who gets what and there is discussion over who gets the big homes and who gets the small homes and how does all of this circulate properly so that we can survive and keep our dignity as a people collectively and it's the keeping dignity part as a society that we fight the most over the dignity part

	<strong>Rhetoric</strong>
	<p>
	It's of the harder I know of to define like I have an incomplete thought of RHETORIC i would think IF you are actually performing RHETORIC you are the MOST protected form of FREE SPEECH if you're STANDING AT A PODIUM ON THE SOAP BOX TALKING INTO A MICROPHONE STANDING STRAIGHT UP and your audience is 50,000,000 in size you are entirely protected to say whatever you want ... WHAT RHETORIC IS ... SPECIFICALLY ... it's hard to pin down what a SAMPLE of rhetoric is ... you know what if you want to help me out you can help me define rhetoric ... i spent 8 years in college before i could see it full time student and now i want more language about it ... like i see something like there is NOT rhetoric and that's hard to define TOO as in also ... but like all i have so far is A CLOUD OF WORDS ... like when someone is just talking or painting in their voice or something i don't know it's something close to this ... but i wouldn't mind an air tight definition for rhetoric the way i have for POLITICS and LITERATURE ... like a short 2 inche definition of literature ...
