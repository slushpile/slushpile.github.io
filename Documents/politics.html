	<p>
	
		A Democrat is a Copy Cat ... like is a democrat a copy cat like they copy rich people like a rich person that owns a business buys a big house and then a democrat tries to buy a big house in the same neighborhood without the business and wants to know why it has to live in a small house ... is that a democrat someone that would copy or mimic someone with a business?

	<h2>States Campaigning for Capital City and We All Vote</h2>
	<p>
	
		If states campaigned to be the nation's capital. The governor would in effect be the president and he would have his entire state to utilize to lead the nation. Every 4 years a new election would be held for the state capital.

it's a political statement website it could be developed into a CMS it's something that's the end result of about 6 years of studying the internet and some school work and it's the kind of website that everyone could create it's not fancy in the code it's just treating HTML like HTML and there's an economy in it in responding to CMS's whose sole PURPOSE is to make your life easier doing this ... FACEBOOK and TWITTER are supposed to be and by the very nature of the CMS are claiming they are making your life easier than taking out hosting and running HTML code like slushpile.github.io instead of THAT they give you FACEBOOK and TWITTER and they claim to make it easier for you to interact with the internet that is all a CMS is supposed to be in intent ... something easier than doing that yourself and you can do all that yourself in HTML and if you can learn to put tags around your writing or fill out an image tag you can do it yourself too minus the ads and end up with a decent URL and i'm just saying the empire of the internet is an unstable one it's supposed to be about the content like the content is what is supposed to set a website apart from another and the content management system is developed by computer science engineers to help make it easier to list HTML TAGS in precedence on a website<br> <br>

if you don't have 25 minutes to spare FACEBOOK and TWITTER can treat you like a product which is their stated business plan turn the consumer into a product which is how it's free they make operating costs off of you using their website that they developed to make it easier for you to do something than slushpile.github.io<br><br>

my political statement is don't assume someone is too stupid for HTML

since i saw the ad on television would you sponsor me for an advertisement on my website ... <br><br>

could i have a car for $25,000 worth of advertisement over 10 years on github a stable platform<br><br>

i need gas too <br><br>

i'm on disability<br><br>

i think my website is special because it intentionally goes to show that HTML is a viable alternative to FACEBOOK or TWITTER and if you have a desktop computer you can make your daily statement in HTML and be just fine and GITHUB does provide hosting in such a way that you can collaborate with someone and split a website into two owners <br><br>

If I taught HTML in Schools to College Seniors the people you most want doing this if I toured and taught HTML in workshops would you give me a car?<br><br>

I'm a University of Cincinnati Graduate 2010 and I would wear the color of the car in my clothing and would wear a NISSAN pin and NISSAN hat and NISSAN badges on my arms if you gave me a car for doing a website like this and then teaching HTML in schools so that we could all benefit to a greater degree from our educated citizens<br><br>

i'm nick<br><br>

i live in North College Hill in Cincinnati Greater Metropolitan District<br><br>

		currently according to google here the average american income is $60,000 a year ... I'm on JUST disability and I make roughly $8000 a year and I think disability should be tied to the national income average i think it should be reviewed every year and placed at 22% roughly 1/5th of the national average income ... 

		nothing

		i've been addicted to smoking for a long time and it just makes it hard when you're poor and addicted to cigarettes and nicorrette gum costs $60 a package like i pay $5 for smokes so it's cheaper just to smoke but I want to quit and i think my main problem is that nicorette gum is $60 a package otherwise i wouldn't have a problem if i could quit smoking if i could quit feeling like shit when only a cigarette can cure i'd be better off but it would make sense that the cure to smoking would be so expensive you would think you're better off smoking

		weed ain addictive not really not at all actually like you look forward to smoking it but it's not like you feen for it between smokes nothing 

		i had a thought

		that disability would be 22% of the average income reviewed yearly

		sincerely,

		n
