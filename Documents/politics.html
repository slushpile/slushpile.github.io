	<h2>States Campaigning for Capital City and We All Vote</h2>
	<p>
	
		If states campaigned to be the nation's capital. The governor would in effect be the president and he would have his entire state to utilize to lead the nation. Every 4 years a new election would be held for the state capital.

it's a political statement website it could be developed into a CMS it's something that's the end result of about 6 years of studying the internet and some school work and it's the kind of website that everyone could create it's not fancy in the code it's just treating HTML like HTML and there's an economy in it in responding to CMS's whose sole PURPOSE is to make your life easier doing this ... FACEBOOK and TWITTER are supposed to be and by the very nature of the CMS are claiming they are making your life easier than taking out hosting and running HTML code like slushpile.github.io instead of THAT they give you FACEBOOK and TWITTER and they claim to make it easier for you to interact with the internet that is all a CMS is supposed to be in intent ... something easier than doing that yourself and you can do all that yourself in HTML and if you can learn to put tags around your writing or fill out an image tag you can do it yourself too minus the ads and end up with a decent URL and i'm just saying the empire of the internet is an unstable one it's supposed to be about the content like the content is what is supposed to set a website apart from another and the content management system is developed by computer science engineers to help make it easier to list HTML TAGS in precedence on a website<br> <br>

if you don't have 25 minutes to spare FACEBOOK and TWITTER can treat you like a product which is their stated business plan turn the consumer into a product which is how it's free they make operating costs off of you using their website that they developed to make it easier for you to do something than slushpile.github.io<br><br>

my political statement is don't assume someone is too stupid for HTML
