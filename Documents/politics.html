	What a democrat is?
	</h2>
	
	<p>
	
		A Democrat is a Copy Cat ... like is a democrat a copy cat like they copy rich people like a rich person that owns a business buys a big house and then a democrat tries to buy a big house in the same neighborhood without the business and wants to know why it has to live in a small house ... is that a democrat someone that would copy or mimic someone with a business?

	<h2>States Campaigning for Capital City and We All Vote</h2>
	<p>
	
		If states campaigned to be the nation's capital. The governor would in effect be the president and he would have his entire state to utilize to lead the nation. Every 4 years a new election would be held for the state capital.

		HTML iz a content management system

it's a political statement website it could be developed into a CMS it's something that's the end result of about 6 years of studying the internet and some school work and it's the kind of website that everyone could create it's not fancy in the code it's just treating HTML like HTML and there's an economy in it in responding to CMS's whose sole PURPOSE is to make your life easier doing this ... FACEBOOK and TWITTER are supposed to be and by the very nature of the CMS are claiming they are making your life easier than taking out hosting and running HTML code like slushpile.github.io instead of THAT they give you FACEBOOK and TWITTER and they claim to make it easier for you to interact with the internet that is all a CMS is supposed to be in intent ... something easier than doing that yourself and you can do all that yourself in HTML and if you can learn to put tags around your writing or fill out an image tag you can do it yourself too minus the ads and end up with a decent URL and i'm just saying the empire of the internet is an unstable one it's supposed to be about the content like the content is what is supposed to set a website apart from another and the content management system is developed by computer science engineers to help make it easier to list HTML TAGS in precedence on a website<br> <br>

if you don't have 25 minutes to spare FACEBOOK and TWITTER can treat you like a product which is their stated business plan turn the consumer into a product which is how it's free they make operating costs off of you using their website that they developed to make it easier for you to do something than slushpile.github.io<br><br>

my political statement is don't assume someone is too stupid for HTML

since i saw the ad on television would you sponsor me for an advertisement on my website ... <br><br>

could i have a car for $25,000 worth of advertisement over 10 years on github a stable platform<br><br>

i need gas too <br><br>

i'm on disability<br><br>

i think my website is special because it intentionally goes to show that HTML is a viable alternative to FACEBOOK or TWITTER and if you have a desktop computer you can make your daily statement in HTML and be just fine and GITHUB does provide hosting in such a way that you can collaborate with someone and split a website into two owners <br><br>

If I taught HTML in Schools to College Seniors the people you most want doing this if I toured and taught HTML in workshops would you give me a car?<br><br>

I'm a University of Cincinnati Graduate 2010 and I would wear the color of the car in my clothing and would wear a NISSAN pin and NISSAN hat and NISSAN badges on my arms if you gave me a car for doing a website like this and then teaching HTML in schools so that we could all benefit to a greater degree from our educated citizens<br><br>

i'm nick<br><br>

i live in North College Hill in Cincinnati Greater Metropolitan District<br><br>

	<p>
		currently according to google here the average american income is $60,000 a year ... I'm on JUST disability and I make roughly $8000 a year and I think disability should be tied to the national income average i think it should be reviewed every year and placed at 22% roughly 1/5th of the national average income ... 
	</p>
	<p>
		nothing
	</p>
	<p>
		i've been addicted to smoking for a long time and it just makes it hard when you're poor and addicted to cigarettes and nicorrette gum costs $60 a package like i pay $5 for smokes so it's cheaper just to smoke but I want to quit and i think my main problem is that nicorette gum is $60 a package otherwise i wouldn't have a problem if i could quit smoking if i could quit feeling like shit when only a cigarette can cure i'd be better off but it would make sense that the cure to smoking would be so expensive you would think you're better off smoking
	</p>
	<p>
		weed ain addictive not really not at all actually like you look forward to smoking it but it's not like you feen for it between smokes nothing 
	</p>
	<p>
		i had a thought
	</p>
	<p>
		that disability would be 22% of the average income reviewed yearly

		<strong>Dear Brad Wenstrup 7/29/20 </strong>
	<p>
		From a producer of the artform's perspective I did a brief study on astrology last year and I found a highly detailed highly ornate book at the center of the work of 17th century astrology and it's clearly an important book and it's clearly an important work and it's clearly a way to entice people into thinking you are important because you generated the all important book. I understand my work to be facetious is all important you just have to understand the genius I am working with here so that I can get paid and laid. 
	</p>
	<p>
Facebook was in the news today and I don't care about the other ones but facebook is a work of astrology. A lot of people are involved a lot of money is at stake and its all based on showing people something. It's astrology a lot of the internet is a work of astrology. My website at https://slushpile.github.io is a work of astrology. As I understand astrology I get what the expert will tell you but it looks like it's something that a lot of work was put into and is highly ornate and is meant to impress.
	</p>
	<p>
I would say facebook is like astrology plus because they can make an argument that it's slightly useful which is something an astrologer can't do if you ask a bona fide astrologer what the point of their work is they can only leave you with nothing, facebook has a chat function.
	</p>
	<p>
In dealing with the internet, maybe do a federal case study in astrology. It might do some good. Really step outside the world of the book and see astrology. I know that's partially true because that's my argument why I'm important because I did hard work on something detailed. 
	</p>
	<p>
Astrolgoy, know your astrology from your bona fide internet.
	</p>
	<p>
Sincerely,
	</p>

	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCSo2hZRcXk i saw this and wanted to point your attention to print on demand i understand you have issues with fiscal resources ... it's a high minded idea but it's worth considering though but if west virgina vied for a contract that it would print out the internet it could be a major industry ... print on demand is also something that you could discuss ... but you could get a major contract printing out the internet and filing it into a library ... if West Virginia was where the internet found a home in the archives as I understand it west virginia is coal mining and your coal exports and your coal mining are the reason we have the power for an internet ... if the source of the internet and the media tool was also the home of the internet in that you would be going through the most major ink acquisition anyone ever achieved and you could also be the thing that prints off all several million of the kdp books and i live in Cinicnnati Ohio I'm a seasoned University Graduate that doesn't need much and when i see poverty i just kvetch there's no reason a sizeable population should be poor there are things you can do and writing is a major component in a resurgence of the faith in people and you can and should be writing and producing artistic works which is the origin of industry and you can solicit an economy based on writing an economy a means of spending and receiving paper currency ... i think i could help you i would be spending government money that i would apply for and write for and basically you could hire me as a professional grant writer that would work with you to secure a contract to print out the internet and have it housed in a facility in west virginia's capital ... i look forward to hearing from you ... it would be a permanent contract
