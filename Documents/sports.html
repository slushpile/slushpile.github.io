	I only ever came up with one sport. 4 Way Sprinting it's when you square off at 90 degree angles with 3 other people and you just see who can run the furthest in an 5 minutes ... whoever gets furthest from the center in 5 seconds and lays their puck where their right foot is and then the referee comes back and measures the distance from the center yeah you can also do it in race form like who can get the furthest in 5 minutes like you can use a track to like start to 5 minutes how far you get it's got to be 5 minutes so that strategy is used ... it's a good office game olympians would probably just run for 5 minutes but even then they may engage in acts of strategy among those that run the entire way i envisioned the game that people would stop and take breaks but it's how far you can run to push it to the limit how far can you run in 72 hours?
