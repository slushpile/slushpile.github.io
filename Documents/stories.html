<h1>Stories</h1>
	
	<strong>Opening</strong>
	<p>
	This is a collection of story lines I am writing for a number of reasons. First and foremost like some kind of mathematician I am only really interested in the overarching equation of a novel and I think this is a solid niche to fill in the world of literature. Sort of like poetry but also at the same time sort of like prose the story line is the kind of thing that I could talk about at a confernece and give a lecture about the story line the thing that is very precise in it's portrayal of a segment of thought that is pleasant to read. I don't wnat to write 200 pages exploring a story again right now like I have done before but I want to explore how many stories can I think of. I think there is a reason that there is a storyline book coming from me and it's because I keep whittling down what i need to do to the basic elements and at hte most simplistic level a story line satiates the need to read and be informed and have something to think about and it's short so you can find enjoyment in perusing through a couple dozen story lines and get a unique experience. I think the story line concept that leads to a novel is something I have never seen it's original and plays with an ancient craft which is perfect for me. The ancient art of storytelling distilled down to poetry.
