	Chapter 1
It was the age of internet and it was it was the age of CNN. It was the pressure to succeed and it was the pressure to create. You could explain all of this to a man and he would understand wholeheartedly. Dick was sitting at his computer and Ze was laying on the couch staring at the ceiling. 

“Dick wutcha doin?” said Ze.

“I’m scrolling through a news feed on facebook and I think I’m participating in the new cycle. I just left a comment on the Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg about how I wish her well in her pursuit of fulfilling her obligation to the court to reign as a life long member. She’s been a supreme court justice since 1993.” Said Dick.

“It’s 2020.” Said Ze.

“I know. She’s one of the longest standing members of the court.” Said Dick.

Dick went back to scrolling through the news feed looking for a topic he can write on. 

“You know I never knew Facebook was going to be a major part of my life like I never knew Facebook was going take up so much of my time.” Said Dick.

“Yeah I avoid the whole thing. I know you’re doing something important though Dick. Dick you are important so if you’re doing it it’s important and I know ABC CBS NBC whoever when they read your comments they take it to heart and they hold meetings based on your comments and memo’s are passed around and you have changed lives Dick.” Said Ze.

“I doubt it. I’m probably only writing for the people that read the comments. When you create a page they’re probably not looking at more than statistics on their pages. ABC probably never once read one of my essays. Said Dick.

“I know said Ze I know. You want a back massage?” said Ze.

“Yes. Yes I do want a back massage.” Said Dick.

Ze came over and stood there topless and rested her chest on the back of Dick’s head and she massaged his shoulders. Ze fucking started kneading the neck muscles of Dick and they sat there in Union for a second Ze didn’t care about her shirt it was summer and it was hot in the apartment and Dick was sitting there and he gave her a place to stay Ze felt like she should do some extra things because she has so much money now on Social Security since Dick’s Social Security Check covers everything and that’s how they met they met in the Mental Health Hospital and first they thought each other was cute. They did have that. They did think each other was cute. Dick went up to Ze at Summit Behavioral and was just like we’re trapped and she was like for good reason and they just became fast friends at first. Dick found himself standing in line for some medication and Ze would hold his place in line while he went to get some water and then she let him cut in front of her and they were like a team. Dick let Ze cut in front of him in line for breakfast lunch and dinner and the troupe of mental health patients knew they were a couple and the staff commented a couple times that they can’t touch each other that’s how close they were they would be sitting there watching television and their hands would be close toe each other just ceremoniously and staff would tell them to move further apart and it was a world of mental illness but Dick and Ze together talked to each other about how they could hear voices in their heads and Dick was certain he was telepathic and Ze wondered if she was and they did this experiment to test it out to see if they could read each other’s thoughts so Dick tried as hard as he could to get a message into Ze’s head and they said it didn’t probably work like that and they did hear that they were both on social security ze and dick talked about it. They were considered disabled and Dick remarked that Ze looked fine for being disabled and Ze remarked that Dick looked fine for being disabled.

“We’re bipolar.” Said Ze

“I know, I know we’re bipolar.” Said Dick.

“We’re both bipolar type one.” Said Ze.

“I know it’s why we can’t get jobs. We have to live on social security and peter out an existence while our peers fucking make monumental strides in their careers.” Said Dick.

“How is the website going?” said Ze.

“The website is sweet. I took an author’s intent on a Content Management System and I have yet to do the PHP. I’m still working on the HTML and the structure of the document.” Said Dick.

“Just make sure people can chat.” Said Ze.

“I don’t know if I can do that I think Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch have that covered. I don’t need legal hassles or to run into a fucked up situation.” Said Dick

“Oh it’s just a website.” Said Ze.

“No it’s not just a website, it’s like a chess piece and as smart as they tell me I am I should be able to make a decent chess move. I’m hoping my CMS makes more sense than Facebook. I just want it to make more sense. Facebook has been up for 20 years it’s a major part of the system. I can hope for something like ELLO or DIASOPORA in my development of my CMS. Next step is CSS and then I have to add the PHP and link it up to a database.” Said Dick.

“Okay Dick. Well we’re rich. I am. I have my entire check to myself a month because of you. You’re special. I can go shopping. I don’t know what else there is to do.” Said Ze.

“I know Ze. Now bring home something that sparkles. We’ve got photographs to take.” Said Dick.

“You would photograph me again?” said Ze.

“I’d photograph you again.” Said Dick.

“What do you do with the photographs?’ said Ze.

“Nothing write now. I just have them in a folder.” Said Dick.

“Well photoshop them.” Said Ze.

“Do what?” said Dick.

“Photoshop them, make my tits look bigger or something.” Said Ze.

“Okay.” Said Dick.

Chapter 2

So mark Zuckerberg is on slushpile.com and he’s says something like 

“Da fuck is this guy? The hell he doing doing ad supported free advertising?” said Mark Zuckerberg

“It’s on github.” Said Penelope.

“I know so it can be forked and we could be dealing with two dozen of these any minute now.” Said Mark.

“You’ve been the leading website for the last 15 years mark. It’s a lock. You’re always going to have the best website.” Said Penelope.

“It’s beyond having the best website it’s identifying anyone that would try to come out with something cooler than me. Cool can happen fast. It might not look like it but I hold a fragile position and his website is just so much cooler than facebook I can’t deal with this. I have to meet him in person.” Said Mark.

“What?” said Penelope.

“I just have to meet slushpile.github.io I have to meet this man he’s currently like he already has all 100 links lined up and an advertiser he’s maxed out his design. It’s cooler than facebook. Do you think I should send him a message on facebook?” said Mark.

“No. Mark I do not think the CEO of Facebook should send a message to Dick because of how cool his website is. Dick might get the wrong idea.” Said Penelope.

“Well how do I handle this?” said Mark.

“Have your lawyers contact him and request a meeting.” Said Penelope.

“Alright. I’ll have jake write up the letter. I like jake.” Said Mark.

“Jake is likeable.” Said Penelope.


Chapter 3

Ze was on a walk. She was power walking. She was in charge of her womanhood. She was walking with ZEST. She was walking the calories off. She was staying thin. She had a Big Mac from McDonald’s yesterday and she wasn’t going to get any scooge. She had a scale. She knew here numbers. She was 160 solid. She kept it there. She wasn’t putting up with food. Food can suck dick. She can fucking walk all this off and feel the breeze. She had her chest out. She was fucking in charge right now. She was walking down the street she was in charge she was the master of her destiny and she had Dick back home. She was in a good situation. She thought all this. She thought all this with a mighty distemper for anyone that would get in the way of her happiness. She was with Dick and Dick was a billionaire. He had slushpile.com that is what the internet is. Metaphorically it’s perfect. It rides the lips the right way. It’s just flawless. And he’s selling ads and people can post ads. I believe in it. It’s a PHP script he told me. This is going to work out. Someone paid him for an ad and he’s doing great.

Ze was walking down the street. She had a power walking strut to her. < Like that not like this ^
