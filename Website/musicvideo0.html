<p>My First Music Video</p>

<p>Alright so like the most pop sound you could possibly imagine is playing like something just super pop.
</p>
<p>Then like you see me taking a nap on a park bench in Burnett Woods.
</p>
<p>Then like I get struck by lighting.
</p>
<p>Then I survive.
</p>
<p>Then I open my mouth and the most powerful lazer ever imagined eminates from it.
</p>
<p>Then I spin in a circle and like take off a slice off the moon, part of like Neptune disappears, and like someone gets offed in another galaxy.
</p>
<p>Then I close my mouth and just look around.
</p>
<p>Then noticing that I am safe.
</p>
<p>I lay back down and go back to my nap.
</p>
<p>Fade into Dream Sequence
</p>
<p>Smurfette is on Vitae Magazine Dot Com leaving a comment.
</p>
<p>Then I wake up again and aim my head down and open my mouth.
</p>
<p>I am now being propelled by the force of the lazer into the sky.
</p>
<p>I pass a flock of bald eagles that are happening by.
</p>
<p>I give the thumbs up that everything is okay.
</p>
<p>I close my mouth for a moment to lose altitude.
</p>
<p>Then I open it up again as I am flexing my entire body.
</p>
<p>I am then propelled into the stratosphere where I am scared shitless.
</p>
<p>Then I realize that I can time travel too.
</p>
<p>So I send the most powerful lazer beam back to the origin of the universe where I start it all over.
</p>
<p>Then I lightly let myself down back to earth.
</p>
<p>Then I realize even that is a dream.
</p>
<p>Then I stand up from the park bench.
</p>
<p>Start whistling.
</p>
<p>Like WHOAH!
