I lost my last Read Me File for Git Hub I was attacked psychically two months ago and lost a lot of files on my computer in my delete status which was positive i was deleting a lot of shit like lists of passwords and content files and it just in hindsight really felt like an attack and i always talk about how telepathic i am most of the time anyways but this website https://slushpile.github.io it's forkable you can fork it.
