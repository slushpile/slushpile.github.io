	<strong>Artistic Statement</strong><br><br>
	https://slushpile.github.io is my website it started in June 2020 and it's an art project it's presence online is a commentary on the overabundance of css and the inability for the average website owner to make changes to their website because of their total ignorance of web languages and by just knowing HTML a website owner could take better control of their website and if they knew CERN the developer of the internet intended HTML to be an all encompassing language to meet all needs for all purposes coupled with email they would upon study of my website come to understand that they can save money on their website gain control of their website and be better able to conduct business with their website ... that's my artistic statement on slushpile.github.io ... someone asked me what a billion dollar business was if i was so smart and was a university graduate and i thought about it and saw an image of teaching HTML nationwide starting with local school districts to me the effect of that procedure would be worth a billion dollars the transformative effects of it ... so https://slushpile.github.io is my website and it's not like facebook that's my angle it's not like facebook at all and just as much work goes into it ... like a website with 44,000 people working on content as opposed to content management would be ideal ...
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<strong>Another Artistic Statement</strong><br><br>
	<a href = "https://github.com/slushpile/slushpile.github.io">A Thought ... </a> I think basically this is the finest website you can have. I have this website which is like 25% away from being the finest website but if you know about https://github.com/slushpile/slushpile.github.io that does the job perfectly like you can line up your file folder on the hard drive you upload the entire thing like automated file management is  the website of the year to me and forever like i spent 20 years something like 6 years studying web design to come to the conclusion that the baseline file managment a hosting provider provides for you is your best option for a website like talk to me as a web master to give you permission to do this and just start populating your shit with content like have a file you put your shit in and if you need organizing put files in your files and files in your files and this style of web design i just want to point out you're done with studying web design when this is your design if you think there is more to do than this you are truly going above and beyond like it's about content that's important and if it's about content management this is the theoretical and practical best way to do it so you can take it from me nicholas lawson for whatever it's worth and know that when you click this link you are looking at perfection and consider this an advertisemnet for github they do hosting for nothing and you have full freedom in HTML if you're looking to compile your code on github i don't know or if you want to use PHP i don't know i know you can use CSS i don't know about javascript but i just need a place to store .doxc files and this will do for me if it doesn't do for you i don't think you're thinking outside the box enough make it work for you so that we can start to wrap this up
