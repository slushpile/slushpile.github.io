	<strong>In Regards to the Open Source Sandbox</strong>
	<p>
	The Open Source Sandbox is a game it's a takeaway from my website, Facebook never gave you anything you never got a file once from facebook like this, and I'm just geeked to be an outlier in some category in regards to facebook and i think that facebook is an excellent website and i have to differentiate myself entirely from it differentiated from NEXT DOOR as i'm not cloning facebook to compete with it i'm differentiating myself to compete with it in a number of categories such as theological understanding of the field of computer science, stringent adherence to web standards, and usefulness in general upon immediate use, and I find that there is a corrolary in my work among itself that leads someone to think to themselves that some thought has gone into this and i posit yes some thought has gone into this and basically with ORIGINAL OPEN SOURCE SANDBOX you want to download the file and then make about 6 months of changes to it just code just fucking code just with what's in your head code just fucking code just have sketches USE PSEUDO CODE and know they could build a compiler to run your code if it had no errors ... coalesce the programming languages into one language and give student  BASIC TRAINING in BASIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES and identify for yourself a reason to be using the internet.

	I gave you a file now it's your turn to do something with it. There's a message encoded in that file that is worth the download to real heads.
