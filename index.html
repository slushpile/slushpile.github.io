        <h1>This is Literature in that It's Writing Critiquing and Discussing Writing</h1>
        <p>I'm going to be receiving a package for my birthday that involves X MEN COMIC BOOKS and ONE-STORY subscriptions. I'm ready to do some english literature and really step outside of fucking with web design for fame and profit and really work on furthering the culture of the english language like i have been absorbing inspiratiuon for a couple years now like 2 or 3 and in the process I have a need to take a fat rhetoric shit on this computer like some rose scented must be a saint shit shits.</p>
