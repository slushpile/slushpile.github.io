	<strong>Artistic Statement</strong><br><br>
	https://slushpile.github.io is my website it started in June 2020 and it's an art project it's presence online is a commentary on the overabundance of css and the inability for the average website owner to make changes to their website because of their total ignorance of web languages and by just knowing HTML a website owner could take better control of their website and if they knew CERN the developer of the internet intended HTML to be an all encompassing language to meet all needs for all purposes coupled with email they would upon study of my website come to understand that they can save money on their website gain control of their website and be better able to conduct business with their website ... that's my artistic statement on slushpile.github.io ... someone asked me what a billion dollar business was if i was so smart and was a university graduate and i thought about it and saw an image of teaching HTML nationwide starting with local school districts to me the effect of that procedure would be worth a billion dollars the transformative effects of it ... so https://slushpile.github.io is my website and it's not like facebook that's my angle it's not like facebook at all and just as much work goes into it ... like a website with 44,000 people working on content as opposed to content management would be ideal ...
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<strong>Another Artistic Statement</strong><br><br>
	<a href = "https://github.com/slushpile/slushpile.github.io">A Website Without an Index File</a> If I was being honest this website right here is the finest website without much experience in running it i would need a .com to know for certain but i think in theory a website that is a list of files is the finest website it's the easiest to work into your work flow as you are creating URLs for a number of contents and it's just beautiful it's a mirror image of your file system on your hard drive and you can juse upload .docx files and you can upload .jpeg and .mp3 and .mpeg files to your folder with minimal effort with fireFTP for Firefox and it's just a blessing of a website to be able to afford that this here will give you access to some code but you already knew that but you can check it out too just saying like the code you get on a file explorer website is nada there is no code it's literally all done for you now you don't get a say in how your website looks but the standard view is valid and it's an exquisite design and it's a file management system that is your website at this level file managemnet it's files being managed and that's a beautiful website that you need no esoteric data on how to create and people can download a .pdf and see the data they need to see when they click on it or click on a music file and listen to  the music or a video file and see the video it's a pretty legit system in theory i have to work with it yet and i have to work on that when i can finally afford hosting but for now i can tell you what my ideal website is it's a content management system

<h4>
Discussion of this SECTION | January 1st 2021
</h4>

<p>
This section is dedicated to my writings to City Council as I have begun my process of recovery from the trauma experienced in the past 20 years of not taking medication there is good in medication it's just that you are traumatized until you start taking your medication and i went from daily scathing business documents to city council and the mayor and the news desk at WCPO I went from lavishing exploration on them and I was really writing peers and working to get my professional rhetoric back in order and from the rudiments of a business concept i present this website from the origins of a thought of needing to make money i present this thought and i rebuilt myself and recontextualized myself and after being severely traumatized i took a solid year to get back into professionoal form and then there was working o ut the kinks and i just lay it on you to forgive me i am just trying to be a stand up citizen in the city of Cincinnati i just want to wake up do my work go to the store and then go back home i just want that life and i am working diligently to make it happen i apologize for my brokeness but i just fell through that crack and just happened to have a university degree anyone can anything any just ANY just AAAAANY like it's a thing that's real like i was caught by the plague and i have to live with it i have to live with having dealt with the plague maybe not covid but the one so many people succub to which is drugs and the drugs make so much sense and i hope weed is a decent drug to do i hope of the drugs i could have done weed was the right one and i smoke roll your own tobacco cigarettes for the last 3 months and it's hell like smoking weed ain bad i don't think but tobacco anyways i just i have kinks in me and lesions and open sores and i'm open sourced and i'm a problem for more people than you i'm a problem for myself.

Newsletter Number One | September 22nd
</h2>

<p>
Item One :E Commerce and Cincinnati
</p>
<p>
An e commerce solution like for example https://www.e-junkie.com/ e junkie allows you to take a file and sell copies of it without damaging or removing the original file. This is a unique product based commercial solution to the issue of making sales to survive. It can be said that a bridge is a suitable focus for an e commerce solution there is drive through traffic that can buy the product as they are driving. You could also schedule a school to sell copies of files that were developed by high school students to raise funding for the school. An apartment complex could write collectively and raise funding for rent in their e commerce solution that involves a billboard outside the apartment complex advertising their writing solutions. Things e commerce can become a part of the equation for.
</p>
<p>
Item Two: Elected Internet Official
</p>
<p>
In terms of press and news and discussion there should be an elected internet user that serves for 2 years and it would surf the web on behalf of city council and basically do this newsletter for city council and become an object of innocent scrutiny just the chosen internet user that we apply FIRST BLACK PERSON to well the white guy would go first but other races and genders would want their chance to staff this chair but the white man that presents the position is the first person to do it for example me i developed this position and i think it should be an elected position the internet user.
</p>
<p>
Item Three:Claim to Fame
</p>
<p>
My claim to fame is that in 1998 when Nick Lachey was big on MTV and 98 Degrees was huge I got a special listen to his album at his parents house when I was over to visit with Gabi the exchange student his family was hosting that I was going to a dance with and I met Nick Lachey and had to tell him I was more into Nirvana than Boy Band Music but I told him it was good and then the next day I was at the mall and i saw like 50 copies of his album at the CD Store but I did make out with Nick Lachey's Exchange Student. That's how famous I am.

<a href="https://www.olympic.org/documents/future-olympic-hosts">Application for the Olympics</a>
</p>
<p>
TITLE : FOUND SOME MISSING FORMS
</p>
<p>
SURPRISED THE SHIT OUT OF MYSELF! there's a fucking document you can download and fill out and host the olympic games if you're chosen ... like CINCINNATI could host the olympic games i think it's clear we're serious about sports we have a professional football and baseball team a professional soccer team recently added, minor league hockey and university grade basketball rivalry in our city i think it's clear that when it comes to SPORT cincinnati is serious about it ...
</p>
<p>
i think it would be cool if we put some glitter on the application to get chosen ...
</p>
<p>
our central location in the USA makes us a worthy logistics option for the olympic games ... 
</p>
<p>
we could at least get thrilled for filling it out ...
</p>
<p>
if you never read this ... i was right about something ...
</p>
<p>
if you never read this ... i'll check but if you never read this and marvel at this link i'll just take a negative view of the internet i don't like things that waste my time and my drawing table wouldn't waste my time but if you never read my emails every single one of them someone anyone like i know something about communications and i'm just trying to get on the same land as you people like you're a type of person
</p>
<p>
but i'm the type of person that finds a URL like this ...
</p>
<p>
you might not know shit about the internet and you're our civic leaders ...
</p>
<p>
bonus i'm surprised like this seems like kind of a ride knowing this is how it went down like i thought to myself is there an olympic application and there's a download link OF the application and that SO CHOICE to me that it seems like i'm on a ride

sincerely,

Newsletter Number Three Business Edition | October 20th 
</h2>

<p>
Drop Shipping : Tai Lopez discusses a situation where you can make millions of dollars if you funnel traffic through a traffic funnel? into a website where you sell products that other people produce and my thinking was if I was going to drop ship products I would drop ship ZERO CALORIE BEVERAGES i would compile a master list of ZERO CALORIE BEVERAGES and i would design a masterful website and I would sell zero calorie beverages. You can drop ship almost anything I drop ship currently https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/nicholas-lawson/the-written-work-of-nicholas-lawson/paperback/product-1e7zdn67.html a book I generated for Lulu.com 15 years ago. I never sold a copy of this book but it's a HOT original collection of poems that I never did anything with. I never promoted this book but there was the one time I gave my contact information to a democratic fundraiser and offered my book up as fundraising fodder and they never got back to me. I figured it could be swag with your $45 donation. I have https://www.amazon.com/Nicholas-Lawson/e/B00XRWK8ZA which I never promoted really but like i don't know people that read and i never knew that many people well I did i just wasn't going to harass my people with my work it would always have to be a stranger buying my work. I don't know in the last year I have mostly kept to myself and even then I had a friend i bought weed off of up the street that finally realized i'm not really like him and this week he never called me and usually he has me over for weed three times a week and I don't mind smoking weed and he's just providing it so i know that's a fucked up situation like there's no FREE WEED but that's what he was seling and i bought a personal supply from him. 
</p>
<p>
But print on demand is a highly interesting novel concept the library has a https://cincinnatilibrary.org/services/makerspace/espresso-book-machine/ and that's noteworthy but is it being put to best use like is the library on the cutting edge of what it can do with the espresso book machine is it really pushing it is it really reaching out to authors is it being used but that's the dream to have one of those and then there is again LULU dot com and what machines do they use and then you have https://www.magcloud.com/ which is a noteworthy site. Cincinnati isn't typically known for publishing that i know of and we recently lost https://www.fwmedia.com/ and that's a loss and a net gain for new york city i bought several of their writers market books before but cincinnati was the authority on where to find an agent but we don't really have a cadre of authors writing for a publisher and all of this can be drop shipped which leads me to my next thought
</p>
<p>
Author's Farm : the author's farm is the concept where you have a billboard outside your apartment complex on a busy street and you pay rent but you also write and you successfully publish enough that drive through traffic visits your website and you make sales with your billboard on you writing. i would like to live somewhere and have my work sold that negates rent payments and if i could earn a living off of book sales i would. the author's farm is a concept like PIXAR it's a place where you have several writers working on perfecting their craft and you work shop a lot and you fucking white board story lines and diagram sentences and it's graduate school for writing but it couild be a little more.
</p>
<p>
social media : https://wt.social/ is a social network that i am disappointed with along with https://nextdoor.com/ for being facebook clones like who goes into something thinking to themselves they're just going to steal an idea? like who invests time effort energy and money into stealing an idea? i don't know i could be off base here but it's in the creative realm they are doing the same thing i can imagine using the same tools needing the same outcome but using the same creative in a creative field? nothing i just nothing i'm probably off base here
</p>

<p>
Okay so I was geeked to do a newsletter for all of city hall Jessica Baker the Director of Constituent Affairs assured me the Mayor does not have an EMAIL ALL button that he can distribute a newsletter link with that sends him to a website i generated to the his entire mailing list she said go ahead and write an email to city council and the mayor because what it is you are asking is something we cannot do i said okay it does seem to make more sense to write to the mayor and city council as an audience than a newsletter this is more streamlined 
</p>
<p>
i wanted to navigate mailing lists like i email the mayor he emails his people a couple of them email back i email their people and etcetera
</p>
<p>
i don't know i wanted to network and do something ... nothing ... 
</p>


<h2>
Newsletter #4 | November 3rd 2020 
</h2>
<p>
Item One : I have been allowed to have a fucked up opinion of the population my mental state has me considering the fact that I qualify as a world leader in terms of my position in society. I have a friend in london  that I communicate with that has a restaurant I have been to europe three times and I used to have a passport. Like on the block like at Ameristop across the street from me I'm the person with the most travel experience and i'm standing in line buying Arizona Iced Tea. I know what went wrong at the juncture where I would go and look for a job the federal government offered to pay my student loans if i made less than $16,000 a year for three years and that happened and now i'm debt free but am experienced in apartment life and because of my blessed position on disability which is only blessed because my folks augment my reality I find that my position in life leads to fucked up opinions but I did score into the genius category on several standardized tests so I wonder if i was spit out. LIke i wrote saatchi and saatchi and i wrote arts wave and i wrote the british arts council and then i got a rude response from the film commission in cincinnati and i just notice nothing it has to do with money but wow like networking is a chore like once you get your finance system nothing i don't know what it's like to have money i'm always doing the approaching but i would think a literary agent would be johnny on the spot to publish one of my books but i get form letters from them i'm like a world leader from an african nation i'll say that like i have an experience level and an income level that are disparate and it's starting to wear on me my latest maslow hierarchy of needs that i need met is recognition i have the apartment i have the stability i have the degree i have the work experience and now my latest need is to be recognized the way buddy is recognized for his business buddy rogers music like i need to stand on my own two feet that's my latest need and as i achieve needs needs appear and apparently i need to keep going in this direction until i become light because television is so goddamned annoying i can't just sit and watch it and zone out but if television had me as a demographic i would just be laying on the couch watching television television does not have me as a demographic i'm not something they think of when they produce programming so i don't get entertained by television and can't sit on the couch and zone out what television apparnetly does have as a demographic is a person that needs basic moral training and that's all i notice
</p>
<p>
Item Two : I hope the education system is sending kids on as many field trips as I went on as a kid. Like major expansions of consciousness of mine as a kid were when i stayed the night at the zoo and to go play with a lemur like that affected me positively. I hope that kids are getting musical theatre and home economics and wood shop and gym and i went to a classic standard by standard definitions of standards school where we had those things and we had different sports teams and i hope there are kids making clocks in high school and using laquer and i hope there are kids taking their first solo performances in musical theatre and i hope there are a lot of extra curriculars because the classroom portion of my entire education process is in my subconscious somewhere it's the doing things element of my education that i have an active memory of like it's hard to remember a random lecture class in arts and sciences but i remember a lot of my studio time from daap and i have fond memories of daap just saying i hope a lot of doing is happening in school to augment the subconscious training that occurs in a lecture setting.
</p>
<p>
item Three : It's election day. Some of you will be with us tomorrow and some of you won't I'll still be doing this news letter every two weeks. I have recently developed some work flows and have some ongoing projects and have grown to thinking of things to do that i can repeat and do over and over again and i'm thinking of lines of work now so that i can go ahead and explicate from a state where i am not doing much. I need to keep busy and the director of community coordination or something from city hall directed me to the email form to send this information and i think i would be useful to city hall in a capacity but it's not like i can just volunteer i will note that i'm a valuable member of society in a world where if we are going to survive we have to just do it you integrate $45,000 a year payments into this whole keeping busy thing as bottom basement payments like people don't talk to you if they think they might have to give you money but like in a world where it's not about money a lot of you fucking get lay wasted by people like me that would just do it and would do it better than you people that get paid to do it like i don't need incentive to work i just work it's in me to work i remember when work was fun and it's not like i can volunteer at an advertising agency that's a bogus concept to them like i can't volunteer at the enquirer and just have something interesting to do like there is a society outside of money it's just a different group of people doing the work the people that didn't need incentive to work and nothing i just notice things i can't even spend time at the church for fear of possibly experiencing a situation where i could get paid and there is no society at the library it's not like i can spend 5 days a week at the library and just build society there they sort of tamp down on commisserating with other library goers i'm just saying someone is extremely happy with how society is structured and they have a lot of money but i was born in the same world they were born in  and i wasn't born with a lot of money any money at that so i look at this from the does not have money perspective and i notice highly experienced people have trouble getting jobs it's been something i have talked about with some people that are in the arts scene in my 30's that if you have a stellar resume you don't get the job but in dealing with people it seems like meat has no trouble getting a job like there are people that have no trouble getting a job and it seems like it's because they know factually that their manager is god and i walk into a situation and i see a group setting and i immediately feel myself in my experience level take on a leadership role not matter how subservient a position you put me in at facebook i'm still more important than mark zuckerberg there apparently i need fucking broken but i mostly pay attention to the work and the buildings are perfect the roads are great the cars are spectacular there's a lot of fucking perfect work out there but it's that office pool quality work that i think needs help

Newsletter Number Five by Nicholas Lawson | November 17th 2020
</h2>
<p>
Item #1 : the Brent Spence Bridge Project has taken up most of my time. I talked to City Council 2 weeks ago to get my bearings on how to handle a Sign on the Brent Spence Bridge that advertised an e commerce website that sold ohio kentucky culture and and i was directed to the county commissioner who decided my issue was a federal issue and sent it to the senate where i followed up with some emails to rob portman and sherrod brown and spoke with one of sherrod brown's interns and it's not like i have a council of individuals to speak with on this issue i don't have a list of state employees i can work with this issue on unless i just started working with random people which as i am writing this i might do but response time i slow i'm used to not getting a response it's pure initiative that drives me to do this like this is my video game i just keep losing everyday but sometimes something cool happens 
</p>
<p>
Item #2 : this newsletter is something that i am working on every two weeks i worked it into my calendar and it's three items and a list of links which is cool. i think you might read this and if i get confirmation of that i could start selling advertising on my website so that i can buy 10 year CD's from the bank that unlock right when i might need them most or something some kind of financial product i need and some shoes. I like doing this it's a weird situation like working in solitude just like if saint francis of assissi was in the cave with an internet connection he might have written like poverty writing like for what i don't know i'm different than the entire planet because i use the internet for it's stated purpose probably to the degree you should be using it if you have a desktop computer i put in my work on the internet it's important to me but without the internet i have a local drive and i write books this is just another word processor that has promise like nothing i just glad we did this
</p>


<h2>
Newsletter Number Six | December 1st 2020
</h2>

<p>
Item Number One : Vitae Magazine @ https://slushpile.github.io took a leap forward yesterday. I added a reddit subreddit and an artistic statement and link to the file directory. I'm thoroughly pleased with my website and it started in July of this year so it's like 5 or 6 months worth of work. It's not the longest lasting website I ever had that was a website I had for a year so I am still working on website longevity which is a big issue when it comes to being a success story. I think I am doing basic web work. It's the kind of website I would think anyone would be able to do. I'm not trying to be technologically savvy I just want a decent content structure.
</p>
<p>
Item Number Two : I found it strange that the Brent Spence Bridge experienced a fire right as Amy McGrath was focusing on it and I responded to her focus by pitching to the County Commissioner Denise Driehaus that they erect a sign on the bridge that promotes an e commerce website that sells local culture. It went to the senate was all I got in the email and there's no real way to work with the senate at my level of networking I get access to a weak intern that almost had a thought this one time and now answers phones for the Sherrod Brown. Like I guess I have to work for this and all I can assume that is is making phone calls but the issue of name comes up and there's apparently a list of people that exist and i'm not on it.
</p>
<p>
Item Number Three : Massachusetts a more culturally advanced State than Ohio recently according to High Times legalized the delivery of recreational marijuana and if you're going to tell me i'm mentally ill then i just want to smoke weed and work on my website. I'd love delivery marijuana from a state distributor. But if you keep up on High Times in the news you'll see the slow growing movement towards full marijuana who am i kidding high times covers the legalization of weed that's their niche and it would be nice if Ohio would explain itself why feeling euphoric is a crime to people like people that never did weed might not know why people smoke weed and weed has the most sound history of any drug weed has a better reputation than liquor in terms of what it can do to you.

<h2>CINCINNATI! Newsletter Number Seven | December 15th 2021</h2>
	<p>
	Photography Law<br>
And<br>
Jeff Pastor<br>
PG Sittenfeld<br>
Tamaya Dennard<br>
</p>
<p>
Number One Photography Law should be on the side of the photographer. We need to live in a society where you can be anywhere and for any reason take a photograph of anyone or anything at any time. We benefit from a society of photographers. A leading cause of not studying photography is because of released that are involved in the shooting of photography. If you are in North College Hill and you are 40 and a a white man you can get picked up by the cops for taking photographs of children at the local high school for your portfolio for your website and that should not be the case. If you have a camera and rightfully so everyone does right now it’s not a silent minority of the population that has access to cameras and the rules of photography are an arcane art. We need more photographs and of more subjects and we need more publishing of photography which means if you do not want your photograph taken in public you do not have the right to avoid being photographed. Rights of the photographer should trump the rights of the subject especially since we went to this trouble to put cameras in everyone’s hands to begin with. If everyone is going to buy a camera then we need to discuss photography rights.
</p>
<p>
Number  Two Jeff Pastor PG Sittenfeld and Tamaya Dennard were recently picked up by the FBI in Cincinnati Ohio for corruptions charges in the form of bribery and they are now awaiting trial and sentencing and jail stays because they accepted cash in exchange for listening to someone make their case about a vote that was coming up. That is lobbying. Cincinnati is such a childish watched too many movies thinks it’s knows how it is can’t even make a decent sandwich at white castle city that it would employ the FBI to take down some of Cincinnati’s Finest because it had evidence they took money in exchange for a vote. They can take money in exchange for a vote and the FBI is not a check on city council city council is checked by the judicial system and it’s constituents and let’s be clear they did take money according to the Cincinnati Enquirer GOOD in this impoverished fucked up about money city they did their job and earned some cash for achieving a position in society that they deserved. They did not take a bribe for writing legislation there is no law being written or act or bill being written because of finances going into their hands they listened to someone make their case for a vote they wanted and they were willing to pay for time and that is not bribery hat is lobbying and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking that you can do that.
</p>
<p>
Number Three When you are asking a woman for her phone number you want to have some time with her that you played with her and you had some fun and then you can be like eh yo can i call you later and she picks up your phone and is like SIRI connect BRITNEY to this account and you can have it like that you just gotta code that hook up app that focuses on the bar and she can call herself too or give you her email address or both like she can make certain you get in touch with her but if it like that she can go home with you that night too like you can stop off at a late night restaurant like we used to do where it 4am and you at perkins drinking coffee with your crw and flirting with the chick in the crew and next thing you know you one the side making out and it's that making out part that's important even if it feels gross you want to make out in europe they have parts of town where if you go there you are supposed to make out like there are town squares in wales dedicated to being with someone like you can turn fountain square into a place where if you one a date in fountain square you supposed to make out for the kissing camera that we set up and like it connected to a website so that when you steped on the button it knew to take a photograph i mean it could take photographs in general but you step on the button and three seconds later it taking photographs and you might want to kiss in those photos like or stand there holding hands or something but when you're getting a girls phone number asking is a big part of it.

A Nintendo cost about $100 when it came out, where is the $100 gaming device now with the $19 games? I played a grip of games that taught me a lot about reading and problem solving on Nintendo and I think I just get a sense from this Playstation and Xbox generation that they’re playing a Casino game that is just bells and whistles and there's not much to it it's like an interactive cartoon with most of the work done for you. I played Playstation at a friends house like the Playstation 4 and it was like a cartoon I could initiate action in with my controller but barely. I know baseball and football games in Nintendo employed skills you had to have to be able to play. Did skill based video games disappear? Where did the cheap video game go? Games now cost like $70 and the station itself costs something like $600 and for what? Are they even playing? When then use these new devices like playing, playing, where is the play? The graphics look like real life they did do a good job at simulating real life Nintendo was not a true to life simulation of how the real world looks and it still had a lot of fun to it and there were games you could play where you had to accumulate experience and you had to solve puzzles and nothing I’m not saying anything I just video games in general just I want a Nintendo I want to play Baseball All Stars with my brother and I want to strike him out.

Human history stretches back for thousands of generations and here we are at the end of time with our telephone we have had for 5 generations with our radio we have had for 4 generations, our television we have had for 3 generations, with our internet we are 2 generations into and with our smart phone we are 1 generation into, in the last 100 years human society has been terraformed in the name of business and we don’t have enough of a data set to know if any of this is a good idea like this technology might all belong in a hospital and that’s about it we don’t know we don’t know if this technology is for the good of mankind we have literally not had enough time to be able to tell but everything seems to get worse in the process of allowing people to use this technology like people seem to be getting worse and we’re not getting our natural inputs that would make us the people we need to be to experience a healthy society.

It doesn’t matter if the bengals won a football game. They’re the best football players in the city. Anyone sitting there discussing with themselves how the bengals suck can suit up and work to do the job of scoring touchdowns themselves. The bengals showed up they put some warm bodies on the other side of the other team and sometimes they scored touchdowns. That’s all you can ask of Cincinnati Football you can’t ask Cincinnati to win games, take home trophy’s you can’t do anything like that you can only know that your city has a team and they play football. They play football that’s what they do they practice they do everything you are supposed to do and it’s still not good enough. I’m a lot like the bengals I’m a losing team I have injuries people don’t believe in me there have been some problems but I’m still playing the game. The bengals are still playing the game you can say that about them.
