	I could start talking about my international experiences I could write for a PRIVATE audience like a breakthrough effects everything .... I have international experience ... I would recommend sending your A students abroad ... i could start a hostel ... like AIR B N B a hostel agency ... like if you need extra cash you can start a hostel ... you'll learn to get along with people ... like i spoke with kaz yesterday and he was morose i've been distant from kaz these last few months and he's my british connect but i know you can send an email instaneously across the ocean which is impressive to me ... deeply ... advertising supported free advertising be like interactive like youtube youtube is advertising supported free advertsing ... i had my breakthrough which was a a fom PHP interacts with&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that lists the entered URL like it's form with required fields and you enter a link and a link name and then you click submit and your link is listed below you and it's like a max list of 100 like for every time you enter your link you get a point and it tracks the number of times you submitted your website ... and that's mean but i could do that&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	Dear Governor
	</h2>
	<p>
	
	I wrote this on facebook ... Nicholas Lawson like standing up for mining is as politically correct as you can get and then there's forestry too and oil and natural gas which is a boondoggle to me how do you mine for GAS? ... like could i ask for permission to run for the house of representatives in the 45239 currently staffed by Brad Wenstrup whom I have written enumerously ... could I have permission to run for the House of Representatives my family deserves a politician in it's ranks you already pay my bills I learned the lesson of poverty there isn't any and I think i could serve as a noteworthy tool furthering ohio's relationships with coal, natural gas, oil, and foresting and national parks I think that's something to become an expert on ... the only caveat is that i am currently on social security with a permanent disability of bipolar type 1 which means i get excited and not depressed which is true that is accurate I don't get depressed. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
i was thinking in the NEXT election the 2022 I could run as a Republican REPLACING or not I don't know the time lines wait my turn? get Brad Wenstrup's Permission? but i'd like to be placed in natural resources like again coal, natural gas, oil, and forestry I'd think that's a stalwart position to take at the onset of a career.
	</p>
	<p>
So with that ... I leave you to yourself ... I have something television news would probably harp on deeply and I would probably commit a finance crime and not know it.
	</p>
	<p>
So ... could we talk sometime? one of your people and me about the House of Representatives could you flesh out what that would mean a little bit more for me so that I can determine IF i should continue my writing studies or if I should start trapsing around to local businesses asking for votes and people to represent in Congress.
	</p>
	<p>
Thank you.

	Find ... rolling stone picked up on this story and apparently some units for phil collins moved for these kids but what i don't know is how can they license music for their youtube channel i've tried to do something similar but i get dinged for unlawful use of music in several countries and i don't know who can see it ... i don't know if the USA could see me do this but this is what i have done before ... i'm usually doing it to a dance track

	<h2>Dear White House</h2>
	<p>
	
	i just got a 12 hour respite period on twitter because while flirting with lilly singh on late night i referenced her skit that dealt with CENSORED WORDS THAT ALMOST MAKE IT and i thought of some words that almost make it and twitter banned me like at some credential point or accolade attained like can't some people deem themselves important enough to just be studied not saying you ignore vulgarity but couldn't they just study it and release papers like some kind of never ending language study since it never stops evolving

	</p>
	<p>
like months pass between days in my world lately like the last time i wrote you i had never written about the fish bowl purchase i started plotting on for PPE and i was laying in bed trying to think of some legally clear P2P concepts that had not already been taken up and i came up with SHARED ACCOUNTS why does every account only have 1 person on it like an account that has 12 logins unique to it but each login leads to the same admin panel and when you write someone maybe something not ONE TO ONE but ONE TO MANY so that when i write (GIKCREW) 12 people get the message and it's an account about representing like MYCREW.COM like crew to crew communications ... something for the east coast i don't know much about the west coast in Cincinnati and Cincinnati is mostly MID EAST
