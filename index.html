<strong>Can Do Attitude</strong><br><br>

I had ground up oatmeal<br> 
I called it wheat<br>
I had pour some coffee<br>
Make it sweet<br>
Educated decisions<br>
I have that to believe<br>
Took a second to listen<br>
To the chardonay cheats<br>

Coke in the Candy Red<br>
Tastes Great and Is My Friend<br>
soda fountains dripping wet<br>
We haven't even popped the top yet<br>
