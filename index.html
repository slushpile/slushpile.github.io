<strong>Can Do Attitude</strong><br><br>

I had ground up oatmeal<br> 
I called it wheat<br>
I had pour some coffee<br>
Make it sweet<br>
Educated decisions<br>
I have that to believe<br>
Took a second to listen<br>
To the chardonay cheats<br>

<strong>Coca Cola</strong><br><br>

Coke Can in the Candy Red<br>
Tastes Great and Is My Friend<br>
soda jerks dripping wet<br>
We haven't even popped the top yet<br>
He wants to help get the syrup right<br>
So that most of the world <br>
Will know they got that taste might<br>
Entirely predictable 
Always a charm<br>
Coca Cola Peepers<br>
With Coca Cola Arms<br>
