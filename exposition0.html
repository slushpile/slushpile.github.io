<strong>7 Things Performing at an Open Mic Teaches You
</strong>
<p>One: Being the center of attention can be extremely cool, fun, rewarding, and invigorating. When you are at the open mic and you are performing for a group of people at your local club you become something that you were not before. You become your best person and you become filled with confidence. When you are performing hot pieces of poetry at the slam competition you are at you become peaceful and serene and you fall in love with the idea that people are really listening to you. That is what makes it cool, fun, rewarding, and invigorating.
</p>
<p>Two: Being yourself and speaking your piece is the most important thing. It does not hurt to speak from the depths of your heart and to fasten yourself to a thought that you can then share with the world at large. When you are performing your writing that you crafted yourself that is your moment to shine and when you come to find out that when you are being the truest form of yourself that even that person is embraced by an audience. That is the whole reason to go.
</p>
<p>Three: Not caring about what people think begins at open mics. I was booed a couple times for my work and I learned it does not hurt to express yourself in a way that people object to and as people were booing me other people were cheering. Its chaos at an open mic but you learn to feel a form of energy that comes out of yourself and when you are just on the edge of your consciousness freestyling poetry and not knowing what you are going to say next in front of a group of people its excitement and more nourishing for the soul than sitting at home and watching television in my opinion.
</p>
<p>Four: Peeking behind the curtains of entertainment begins at open mics if you go to enough shows. If you spend time at a solid show that brings in dozens if not hundreds of people over the months of being a regular open mic show that books talent and that attracts community you can get a pretty good understanding of how the entertainment industry works and then once you have that understanding, you can see through the hype of the smoke and mirrors of the quote unquote celebrity. There is a lot of posturing that goes into celebrity and performing at an open mic helps you care a lot less about the current state of celebrity that is reported on TMZ and Entertainment Tonight and it draws you more into your community and the people around you. All things being equal your best friend is as talented as the winner American Idol and that in fact American Idol is in fact a devout style of open mic … the Slam. Your friend is as talented as the people on television and you are too.
</p>
<p>Five: You learn hand to hand business and how to handle transactions and freeloaders. You learn doorman skills at an open mic. You learn that if you do not take the money from their hands they will try and get to the hot show without paying. You learn that most people are cool about paying but some people feel that they are connected to the show even though they are audience members and it’s the audience members that feel that they are part of the show that cause the most problems. Performers make the show and the audience participates by paying to be entertained. That’s the deal. It pays to remember that at that door.
</p>
<p>Six: Amazing long lasting friendships are fostered at community driven open mics. You meet some amazing people at a regular open mic and it’s cool to see how people have their own voices and facets to their personalities that come out at open mics. Drinks and tea and the fact that you never know what you are going to hear at an open mic that is the center of the city’s consciousness is invigorating and there is a great amount of comradery at the open mic that just cannot be found anywhere else.
</p>
<p>Seven and Lastly: I will never understand why my local church that I was raised in never had an open mic, it seems fair to let the community speak to the community than to have the same person doing the sermon every week. I learned this and maybe you would too if you attended an open mic for enough weeks is that the open mic ceremony while much maligned is a more balanced ceremony for society than the leader driven church model most people are currently aware of and participating in. The world would be much more confident if more people spent more time spending more time speaking in front of more people. I learned that.
