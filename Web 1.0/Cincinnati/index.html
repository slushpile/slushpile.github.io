<h3>
Omnimax Theatre as Product
</h3>
<p>

As a revenue stream coming into the Greater Metropolitan City of Cincinnati if the Carl Lindner Omnimax Theatre 
was marketed to other cities. Not every city has an Omnimax and to get that Hollywood infrastructure where when
a film is debuted it rakes in several hundred million dollars if not billion if the city of Cincinnati started itself
off as a distribution cetner of Omnimax Theatres if we proactively approached cities about building film centerpieces
and then went about the business of producing OMNIMAX content.

<h3>
Bus
</h3>

<p>

If the City of Cincinnati produced subway quality work in it's busing system if there was a network of buses that 
rivaled the ease of use of the car. If we are not going to continue work on the subway if we went about the business
of automating the work of navigating buses and if we had a bus system that traveled 24/7 and bus drivers turned into
light work security guards on the bus. If the buses just ran.

<p>

Cincinnati has a major culmination of industries within it but we are weak in media. If noting this detailed profile of Cincinnati 
if Cincinnati went about developing itself and fleshing out a cadre of business for itself that dealt with media. We are always
most proud of the work people come here to do never the work that we do here ourselves. We would have to study.

<h3>
Mayoral Discussion Forum
</h3>

<p>

There is currently to my knowledge with some searching no Facebook Group or Collectivist Discussion forum dedicated to 
the class of citizen known as Mayor or City Council Member. There are several hundreds mayors and several thousand
council members and there is no online discussion forum for this class of people that is the reason we have a city.
