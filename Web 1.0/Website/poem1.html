<strong>Cincinnati</strong><br>
    <br>
    I am Cincinnati’s Poet Until I Am No More.<br>
    <br>
    I speak with my fingers on an alphabet<br>
    Im the only poet in the game that can win a bet<br>
    32 years strong not over yet<br>
    What else you want to see me do<br>
    Im a muffuckin graduate<br>
    With a univeristy behind my rep<br>
    11 years studying now bout time to collect my check<br>
    Just have to grab this mic and build my set<br>
    Build my gang and take this step<br>
    My alma matta saved me from death<br>
    Im a motherfucking college kid<br>
    Yall dont know shit about college kid<br>
    I come from a college town<br>
    Where most folks is college bound<br>
    And we be rocking that college sound<br>
    If you looking for work we can split this bread<br>
    Just give me a second to catch my breath<br>
    <br>
    Oh my god what just happened to me<br>
    I guess this is what it sounds like<br>
    When you are finally free<br>
    When you finally decree<br>
    When you finally believe<br>
    That at any moment in your life<br>
    You can decide to just be<br>
    <br>
    And find peace in the city of the big red machine<br>
    Where our business is clean<br>
    And we move slow because we peepin the scene<br>
    Ya gotta understand what I mean<br>
    When I say I am living in the city of Queens<br>
    Where its time we came out supreme<br>
    With a resoulution to make cream<br>
    And you wouldnt believe how much I believe<br>
    In the future of we becasue you dont know what I see<br>
    In the only city that ever meant anything to my chi<br>
    I wasnt raised on the streets so I perfectly perceive<br>
    What a city can be because I trained for this moment<br>
    And I know I can own it and show you how to transcend<br>
    And bring back the glory days of this city my friend<br>
    Funny thing about a city is that a city never ends<br>
    We just grow forever and take over the world<br>
    <br>
    Oh my god what just happened to me<br>
    I guess this is what it sounds like<br>
    When you are finally free<br>
    When you finally decree<br>
    When you finally believe<br>
    That at any moment in your life<br>
    You can decide to just be<br>
    <br>
    And this shit fucking actually happend to me<br>
    I been through shit you wouldnt believe<br>
    But no one ever defeated my belief<br>
    That I would get my degree<br>
    Yeah I come from UC<br>
    Where we bearcat proud<br>
    And if you an alumni let me hear you get bearcat loud<br>
    Becasue our city is now<br>
    We was lost but now we is finally found<br>
    Because you were so kind to me<br>
    I tried to walk away but you invited me back to speak<br>
    So I had to give it my all<br>
    And show you how this poet can ball<br>
    Because my poetry’s tall<br>
    And I know the power of a city that sleeps<br>
    And maybe this is our week<br>
    To wake up and be known<br>
    As more powerful than Dow Jones<br>
    Becasue all I need is to make you proud<br>
    Becasue you taught me how<br>
    When you gave me inspiration to study<br>
    You gave me the chance to write<br>
    Now all I have to say is<br>
    Cincinnati Ignite.<br>
    <br>
    Lace up Kells.<br>
    <br>
    See you at the Next Reds Indians game!<br>
