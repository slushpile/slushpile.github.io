	<h1>Discussing Art</h1>
	<p>
	
	A GOOD EXAMPLE OF AN ARTIST is someone that is at the back end of their supply chain and can do it and can see a product through from raw material to finished product. For example CHARCOAL can be created by burning a tree just enough that you get CHAR not ASH but CHAR and then you compress the char and you get something you can draw with.

	A GREAT ARTIST has their own supply of charcoal to draw with because they live near a forest and can get the raw material, because they can create a fire, because they can compress the char into vine charcoal and because they can then render on a sheet of paper and sell the finished product without having spent a dime aside from the cost of the paper which they could also make and then there's the drawing table which which they could also make in the drawing studio they could also make so that they can generate a profit when they sell their painting becasue money never went out work went in.

	In the digital world this is equivalent to hosting your own website on a local drive, I am using github which is close but I want to accumulate knowledge of the digital world so that when I go to make my sale I make the highest margin possible on my sale. It's also endearing to people to be so much of an expert that you can pass along not costs to someone but savings like i could pass along the knowledge of how to host a website on a local drive and save someone money. I want to go into busines saving people money so that i can get paid.
